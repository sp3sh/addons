customised addons

SnickScroll
Another proof of concept, these work out of the box for me but you might need to customise your ids/buffs and trinket details or
remove trinkets completely.

The following functions should be self explanatory if you want to add to this addon:
HealthPercentage, PWRPercentage, playerHasBuff & checkFoodBuff
